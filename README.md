## Feature Branch Development

### Collaboration on Single Repository

### Forking Repository

### Pull Requests 

### Mission #1
For everything below, `$netid` refers to your Duke Net ID (e.g., `apw2`), not your GitHub username.
* Fork this repository: https://github.com/apw2/BME547_lecture4_Jan25
* Clone your forked repository to your local computer
* Create a new branch called `$netid/myinfo`
* In your new branch, create a new file called `$netid.csv`
* Add a line to that file that contains:
```
# Firstname, Lastname, Net ID, GitHub Name
# For example:
Wax, Adam, apw2, awaxye
```
Your Teamname should:
  + Contain no spaces
  + Use CamelCase
* Push your working branch to your GitHub fork
* Using GitHub, submit a Pull Request to merge your branch on your forked repository back into `mlp6/bme590s18_lecture03`

# Mission #2
* Python code to concatenate all of the user data
* Write CSV / JSON

# Mission #3
* Represent data as dictionary
* Represent data as Class/Objects
* Store data in database (MongoDB / SQL)
* Databases are cool
